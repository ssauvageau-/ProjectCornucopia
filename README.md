Rebalancing Mod for Grim Dawn! Read about it:
http://grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=37644

Project Cornucopia aims to make Grim Dawn's endgame difficult for experienced players while welcome to as many different character concepts as possible.

Project Cornucopia also aims to follow along with the 'vision' that Crate Entertainment, the developers of Grim Dawn, have for the base game. We are not Crate Employees, so changes we make are perhaps not 100% of their vision, but we get a better glimpse of their intended product with every comment they make and every update they release.

Speaking of updates, Project Cornucopia has been consistently releasing updates of its own while incorporating changes made to the base game by Crate Entertainment...but only those which we believe are 'healthy for balance', or, rather, those which contribute to the aforemention first goal for the Project.

Project Cornucopia has been featured in a couple mod merges as well, including - but not limited to - the DAIL mod (http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=38785) and the Grimarillion (http://grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=46352)!
